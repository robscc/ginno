[SemVer](https://semver.org/) — pre-1.0, expect breaking changes in minor
versions.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-11-03

### Added

- Full-stack CI: web (lint + typecheck + vitest + build), Rust (fmt + check),
  runtime (pytest with coverage → Codecov) — and green on all three.
- Release automation: `v*` tag → dmg built on a GitHub macOS runner (ad-hoc
  signed), attached to the GitHub Release.
- Frontend test suite bootstrapped (vitest): token formatting, session
  visibility, classname merging, chat waiting-state.
- Community files: CONTRIBUTING, SECURITY policy, PR template, ROADMAP;
  user-facing FAQ / troubleshooting / upgrade / comparison docs.

### Fixed

- Permission denial no longer forks a concurrent agent lane (LangGraph static
  edge + `Command.goto` double-execution; endless-spinner symptom).
- Usage stats expose provider display names instead of raw hash ids.
- Test-suite collection broken since 8d6cb13 (conftest name shadowing) —
  main CI is green again for the first time since then.
- `fmtTokens` doc/impl mismatch (1.25M rendered as 1.3M).

### Changed

- `cargo fmt` baseline for desktop shell + mod-broker (no behavior change).
